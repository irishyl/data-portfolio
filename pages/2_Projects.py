# WikiArt Image Classification

    title="üé® WikiArt Image Classification",
    description="""This study classifies WikiArt images into ten artistic styles using CNN architectures. We leveraged AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50 for feature extraction and applied them in baseline models (SVM, Random Forest) and advanced transfer learning approaches. To address class imbalance, we filtered the dataset to the top 10 styles and used data augmentation to improve model robustness. Baseline models achieved 50‚Äì60% accuracy, while ResNet50 and Vision Transformers (ViT) reached 99.86% and 87.52%, respectively. ResNet50 consistently outperformed other feature extractors.""",

# Can Models Learn Human‚Äôs Helping Behavior?

    title="üß† Can Models Learn Human‚Äôs Helping Behavior?",
    description="""This project builds on Dr. Gureckis and Dr. Osborn Popp‚Äôs study "Moment-to-Moment Decisions of When and How to Help Another Person," which highlights the role of reciprocity in helping behaviors. We use Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning to model and predict helping gestures, exploring how cost, resource capacity, visibility, and prior reciprocity influence decisions. Our approach compares tabular and neural network-based Q-learning models against human behavior. Preliminary results indicate that reciprocity is the strongest predictor of helping, with energy costs and resource disparities also playing significant roles. This work offers insights into the cognitive mechanisms behind altruism and advances computational models of social decision-making.""",
